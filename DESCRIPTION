Description: 
    The gasanalyzer R package offers methods for importing, preprocessing,
    and analyzing data related to photosynthetic characteristics (gas exchange,
    chlorophyll fluorescence and isotope ratios). It translates variable names
    into a standard format, and can recalculate derived, physiological 
    quantities using imported or predefined equations. The package also allows
    users to assess the sensitivity of their results to different assumptions
    used in the calculations.
